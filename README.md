# SysAdmin Weekly Github Community Discussions

Welcome to the official community discussion space for **[SysAdmin Weekly](https://www.sysadminweekly.com)**.

This repository exists to support thoughtful, practitioner-led conversations around the SysAdmin Weekly podcast and newsletter including episode follow-ups, real-world operational questions, tooling discussions, and broader industry topics that matter to people who actually run tech and infrastructure.

When you're ready to starting getting involved in the community, discussions can be found by clicking the [Discussions tab](https://github.com/ProjectRunspace/sysadmin-weekly/discussions). It is **HIGHLY RECOMMENDED** you review the [README](https://github.com/ProjectRunspace/sysadmin-weekly/blob/main/README.md) below before continuing.

## What This Space Is

- A place to discuss **SysAdmin Weekly podcast episodes**
- A forum for **real SysAdmin problems and solutions**
- A space for **tooling, workflows, and operational lessons learned**
- A way to suggest **future podcast and newsletter topics**

Discussions are hosted using **GitHub Discussions** to keep things low-barrier-to-entry, asynchronous, searchable, and grounded in real-world experience.

## What This Space Is Not

- Vendor support forum
- Marketing pitch threads
- Homework help
- A replacement for Stack Overflow
- A Discord-style firehose of half-baked takes

There are plenty of places on the internet for those things. This is not one of them.

## How to Participate

- Be respectful and professional
- Assume good intent
- Share real experience where possible
- Disagree **constructively**. SysAdmins are allowed to have opinions

If you’re posting a question, provide enough context for others to actually help you.  
If you’re sharing a solution, details are appreciated.

## Categories

Discussions are organized into categories such as:

- **Announcements** – New episodes, newsletter releases, and updates

- **SysAdmin Questions (Q&A)** – Real-world admin challenges
- **Tools & Techniques** – Homelabs, scripts, workflows, and configs
- **Topic Requests** – Ideas for future episodes or deep dives
- **Industry Talk** – Broader trends and reality checks

Pick the category that best fits your post. It helps keep things usable (and searchable) over time.
